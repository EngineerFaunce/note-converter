# Note Converter

A small script for converting notes from Google Keep to formats supported by other note apps. 
> At the moment only Google Keep -> [Noto](https://github.com/alialbaali/Noto) conversion is supported, but this may change in the future. 

## Usage

1. Place exported Google Keep notes into the `data/keep-notes` directory 
2. Place `Noto.json` backup file into `data/noto`
3. Run the script. You will be prompted to choose a Noto folder to store converted notes in
4. Once the script is complete you will be able to take the updated Noto backup and import it

# Dream Log Converter

A small script for converting notes from Google Keep to a format supporte by [Noto](https://github.com/alialbaali/Noto). While my purpose for this tool is to convert my personal dream logs, the program can be used to convert anything.

## Usage

Simply place the notes from Google Keep into the `src/keep-notes` directory and then run the program. If no `Noto.json` file exists in the root directory, one will be created; Otherwise an existing backup will be updated.
